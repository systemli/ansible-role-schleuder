# NOTE: This is a very weak restriction mechanism on which you should not rely,
#       as sending addresses can easily be faked! We recommend you to rather
#       rely on the `receive_authenticated_only` option. Setting the
#       `receive_authenticated_only` option to true, will authenticate senders
#       based on the signature on the mail, which is the strongest
#       authentication mechanism you can get.
#       This option could be useful, if you would like to have a closed
#       mailinglist, but could not yet get all subscribers to properly use GPG.
